# NaiveBayesTAN
Consists of implementations of both Naive Bayes as well as TAN

## Requirements
Python 2.7

## Important Scripts
* <b>bayes</b>: Script that calls bayes.py 
* <b>bayes.py</b>: Contains the implementation of Naive Bayes as well as TAN
* <b>*.arff</b>: Sample data files 

## Usage
<b>Command to run the script</b>: ./bayes <i>train-set-file</i> <i>test-set-file</i> <i>n|t</i>

* <i>n</i>: Naive Bayes
* <i>t</i>: TAN 

TAN algorithm uses Prim's algorithm to find the maximal spannign tree.
